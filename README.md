# Assignment 2021 for juinor Dev Position at Reaktor 

## Task
Client is a clothing brand that is looking for a simple web app to use in their warehouses. To do their work efficiently, the warehouse workers need a fast and simple listing page per product category, where they can check simple product and availability information from a single UI. There are three product categories they are interested in for now: gloves, facemasks, and beanies. One requirement is to be easily able to switch between product categories quickly. The client does not have a ready-made API for this purpose. Instead, they have two different legacy APIs that combined can provide the needed information. The legacy APIs are on critical-maintenance-only mode, and thus further changes to them are not possible. The client knows the APIs are not excellent, but they are asking you to work around any issues in the APIs in your new application. Both APIs have an internal cache of about 5 minutes.

#### Build with react/typescript/express
I improved upon the code from assignment 2020 based on the feedback provided. I also tried to use typescript this time.
The code first calls the product Api and stores the manufacturer name for each productItem on set ( instead of hardcoding manufacturers name, I assumed that there might be many and different manufacturers for each product ), then iterates and calls the manufacturer Api.
Global store is used as single source of truth. 
Api calls are timed every 5 minutes and last retrived time is stored. If the data already exists for the given api call and api cache has not expired, data is retrived from store and api call is postponed until cache expires for that call or cancelled if no longer relevent. 
Api Errors are displayed as notification and can retry call from the respective notification button.
Windowing with react-window is used for better page loading performance.
The Api has cors disabled so the application is served via express server through which the api request are proxied to bypass Cors limitation.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
